I am **Subhajit Paul**, a researcher at the **Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) Kolkata**, where I work as a Project Linked Person.

My research focuses on the intersection of **Formal Verification** and **Generative AI**. I am specifically interested in how Large Language Models can automate and improve verification workflows in **Electronic Design Automation (EDA)**. Currently, I am working on **fine-tuning LLMs for Planning Tasks in AI Domains**.

You can find a list of my papers and ongoing work on the [Research]({{site.baseurl}}/publications) page.

Outside of work, I spend my time reading about Indian history, playing cricket, and gardening.
