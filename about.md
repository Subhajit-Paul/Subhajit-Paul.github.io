## About Me


I'm **Subhajit Paul**, a **Project Linked Person** at **Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) Kolkata** with a strong passion for **formal verification, generative AI, and electronic design automation (EDA)**. My research lies at the intersection of **Formal Verification and Generative Artificial Intelligence**, where I develop frameworks to simplify and automate verification workflows.

### Research Interests
I'm particularly interested in developing frameworks that leverage **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to automate and enhance verification processes in **Electronic Design Automation (EDA)**. My current research focuses on:
- **SystemVerilog Assertion Generation** using LLMs
- **Model Reconciliation** for robotic path planning
- **Agentic workflows** in EDA for verification environment generation

### Professional Experience
- **Current Role**: Project Linked Person at Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata (July 2024 â€“ Present)
- **Previous Role**: ML Engineer Intern at Xetalabs India, Guwahati (January 2024 â€“ July 2024)
- **Notable Projects**: 
  - Developed LLM-powered chat application for Northeast Frontier Railway
  - Created OCR-to-vectorization pipeline for automated document information retrieval
  - [Golpokotha](https://subhajit-paul.vercel.app/ml/llm) â€“ Personal chatbot with memory using Mistral 8x7B

### Education
- **B.Tech. in Computer Science & Engineering** from The Neotia University (2020-2024) - CGPA: 9/10
- **HS Education with PCM** from Jhapardah Duke Institution (2018-2020) - 82%

### Publications & Research
- **LISA: LLM-Informed SystemVerilog Assertion Generation** - Accepted at IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI 2025)
- **LLM-Guided Reconciliation for Explainable Robotic Path Planning** - Accepted at IEEE Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing Systems (ACSOS 2025)

### Technical Skills
- **Programming Languages**: Python, C, C++, JavaScript, Java, SystemVerilog
- **Research Areas**: Formal Verification, Large Language Models, Electronic Design Automation, Computer Vision
- **Tools & Technologies**: NextJS, Huggingface, AWS EC2, Firebase, Android Studio
- **Approach**: Developing innovative AI-driven solutions for complex verification and automation challenges

### Achievements
- **Publications**: 2 accepted papers at prestigious IEEE conferences (ISVLSI 2025, ACSOS 2025)
- **Team Leadership**: Led team to **39th Rank in Amazon ML Challenge 2023** (mentored 4 team members)
- **Projects**:
  - [Golpokotha â€“ LLM chatbot with memory](https://subhajit-paul.vercel.app/ml/llm)
  - [PSYCLE â€“ Wallpaper Recommendation App](https://github.com/Subhajit-Paul/psycle)

### Personal Interests
Beyond research and development, I have a deep interest in **Indian history**. I also enjoy **playing cricket** and **gardening** as ways to unwind and stay active.
